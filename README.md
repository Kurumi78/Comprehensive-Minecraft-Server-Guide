**Bukkit Based Server Software/Server Jars**
There are many different bukkit server jars you can chose from, as it is by far the most widely used type of server. For more information please see the BUKKIT (currently unmade) section. Here is a quick list of all the specific jars I will be talking about.

- CraftBukkit
- Spigot
- Paper
- Tuinity
- Purpur
- Airplane
- Yatopia

Craftbukkit - CraftBukkit is the most barebones server software that you can use except for Vanilla itself. It has no extra bells and whistles.
			  	It can run plugins, and not much else. It performs terribly compared to other options, use only when others will not work.
			  	
Spigot - Spigot is the CraftBukkit jar with a few extras added on. It has basic performance improvements and basic config settings. Nothing to fancy.
			While the performance is better than CraftBukkit, it leaves much to be desired. 

Paper - Paper is the go-to Server Software for many servers. A modified version of Spigot, it is Rock Stable, and performs much better. Paper's config
        ontop of spigot can configure most things. Runs certain things asyncronously for performance. The definition of "drag and drop".

Tuinity - Tuinity is a version of Paper used to add more Performance Patches. Tuinity is designed for higher playercount servers, and performs better under those circumstances.
		    While not unstable, Paper is reccomended unless you hit 30+ players. Reccomended.

Purpur - Purpur is a modified version of Paper designed to add extra gameplay affecting config options and settings, such as rideable mobs, and a customizable F3 Brand.
			Purpur also incorporates much of what Tuinity does for performance, however it is not based off of Tuinity. 
			
			
Airplane - Airplane is the absolute pinnacle of minecraft server performance. Designed for very high playercounts (100+), it runs amazing. However is overkill for most users.
				Other than that, Airplane is build on-top of Tuinity. 


Yatopia - Yatopia is built ontop of Tuinity and Purpur. Yatopia is much faster but at a cost. It is very unstable and has been known to corrupt worlds and other such things.
			The developers have also been known to not take well to advice or criticism.
