# Contributing Guide

Contributing is easy! Simply fork the project and make a pull request with your changes. 

To add a section on a plugin, see [here.](Plugins/Instructions_for_Documentation.md)

Pull requests will only be accepted if they improve the guide in some way shape or form, and use proper formatting and grammar.
