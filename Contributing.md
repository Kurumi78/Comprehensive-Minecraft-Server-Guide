# Contributing Guide

Contributing is easy! Simply fork the project and make a pull request with your changes. 

To add a section on a plugin, create a new file within the plugin folder named "(plugin-name.).md", and add the guide there, then make a link in the main plugin section linking the name of the plugin to the file, with the proper name. 

Pull requests will only be accepted if they improve the guide in some way shape or form, and use proper formatting and grammar.
